# Summer2016-Picture Altering project

<p>This is a fun project that I did for fun when I was still a second-year student. In the end it becomes too big for me to handle. This is before I know about version control so I cannot upload all of the files I used to do. But I will still upload the core codes and the examples.<p>

<h2>Part 1: Making pictre</h2>
<p>This is a fun project that I did for fun when I was still a second-year student. In the end it becomes too big for me to handle.<p>
<p>The concept is simple: I used an original picture and build a Java program to convert it to a painting or a sketch<p>
<p>The method is basically loop through all of the pixels, check the range of its color (RGB) and decided which color it gonna be.</p>
<p>For the colors I used, I have created them by using the class: <a href="https://github.com/phNam2/Summer2016/blob/master/Converting_Image/src/experiment/CreateColor.java">CreateColor.java</a>. and stored them in the folders: <a href="https://github.com/phNam2/Summer2016/tree/master/Converting_Image/colors">colors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/phNam2/Summer2016/tree/master/Converting_Image/colors3">colors3</a></p>
